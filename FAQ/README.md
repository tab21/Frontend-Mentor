## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Javascript
- Jquery (javascript library)

### Continued development

Positiong elements is something I still sometimes find Difficult specially when making them responsive.

In this I specially found positioning Illustrations which took quite a time and I believe is still not perfect.

Thus, Learning and using some other positioning such us fixed, static, sticky is someting I need to refine.
